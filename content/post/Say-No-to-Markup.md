**I am curious, and feeling bit rebel.**
Why XML, why any specific data defining flat file schema and markup.
We have progressed so far, and still working with boundaries of any markup??
1. Why We are with in language barriers, in computer science. This post is in English, Markup and definition is in English. Brackets which are used are from english. 
2. Why not diagrams ? Why not some circutry.. plain vannila.. photographs. Will that will not make everyone happy ?
3. Why XML ? another debate, and why markup ? Why not JSON/YAML/TOML/Binary or any other format.. as thing should be predictive. Right. XML just because of DTD or XSD being predictive which is another markup..
4. I want my friends, who are mathematicians, for them, to do their job best with out learning a new language, they can use their own universal language which is numbers. Isn't computer language / markup or this innovation comes from mathematics.. and who say mathematics can't be diagrammatic..
