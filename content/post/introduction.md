>I want to write about lot of things, but, i lack the strength for writing. I know, I am lazy, Still projection is a good thing. And this is the best thing, i am good at. Another thing, where i am best, is thinking about the worse.  I took a very long time, to start this blog. 7 + years, in the making. What made this delay is a lot of things, but most importantly the comfort. I was not comfortable with the blogging platforms, i didn't had control. I can't be online all the time, and working offline was almost impossible for blogspot, wordpress, tumbler etc. Believe it or not, i have tested all.

Now, my last experiment with hexo and travis-ci left a bitter taste in my mouth. Reason, It was not for lazy blogger like. A bit slow, and a bit less control.
**So why i am starting this again?**

I found things simplyfying for me now.
Hugo and wercker works like a charm for me, how. I am experimenting on it, from last couple of months, and found it best suited for my needs. 
Theme system, is so simple, yet, most powerful in a lot, out there.
Using Sekeltonn CSS, and a very helpful hugo community out there, things, i learnt puts me on a total control.
Yes, Taxanomy, is still a pain for me, and i am not an artist, or CSS or JS GURU. Still, i took time, and tried to create a very simple blog. And that was amazing.
**Tags and Categories are yet to come**
But something was very clear, i checked out lots of things from my list.

1. ~~learn markdown as pro~~ It was never required, and playing with markdown, just write, write and write, and don't bother is the thing, which i learnt. Post can be updated, now, any time. And build to deploy in a minute, with  and that too went automated, with commit. :)
2. ~~optimize css~~ NEVER GONNA HAPPEN 
3. ~~move from ejs theme to handlebar theme~~ Not required any more
4. ~~have total control on output~~ Never gonna happen 100%, but 70-80% achived. Control, optimizatian and automation are relative fro person to person. Still, i am happy, as from past, i have approximately 7 fold of power.
5. ~~find a place to host images~~ FLICKER. my olderst friend, and still, booming.
6.~~optimize site for speed, currently speed is very bad~~ Now, just Font awesome's font and github camo are a bottleneck, else, nailied it. :) 
7. ~~I am using sublime text 3 for typing, this blog, most of the time. I don't know right know, how good this setup is going to be, but for now, this looks ok, but still impossible~~ Go to github, and just write or copy paste from notepad. Easy Peasy. No dependency on any editor.

**Completely Random: This is a homage to old list, which is never gonna make it. as Things are more controlled now. Stay tuned with this blog, to learn more.**
